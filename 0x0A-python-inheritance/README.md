# 0x0A. Python - Inheritance

As I am diving deeper in Object Oriented Programming (OOP) with python, this project introduce me to the concept of inheritance

Inheritance is a very important mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class. For example, a puppy inherits the traits of its parents. With inheritance, we can reuse the fields and methods of the existing class. Hence, inheritance facilitates Reusability and is an important concept of OOPs.

Python has two built-in functions that work with inheritance:

* Use isinstance() to check an instance’s type: isinstance(obj, int) will be True only if obj.__class__ is int or some class derived from int.

* Use issubclass() to check class inheritance: issubclass(bool, int) is True since bool is a subclass of int. However, issubclass(float, int) is False since float is not a subclass of int.
