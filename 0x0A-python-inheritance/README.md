# 0x0A. Python - Inheritance

As I am diving deeper in Object Oriented Programming (OOP) with python, this project introduce me to the concept of inheritance

Inheritance is a very important mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class. For example, a puppy inherits the traits of its parents. With inheritance, we can reuse the fields and methods of the existing class. Hence, inheritance facilitates Reusability and is an important concept of OOPs.
